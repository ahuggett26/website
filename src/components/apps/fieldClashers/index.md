# Field Clashers

## About

Field Clashers is a passion project, that I have worked on during my weekends and free time
roughly over the course of a year. Inspired by Super Auto Pets and tactical battlers like Pokemon,
I wanted to combine a love of strategy games with football. The result of this is Field Clashers.

Field Clashers is a strategy battler, where you can take your favourite team and pit them against
another, across a single match or through a tournament, online or offline. Give yourself the edge
by picking your best starting 11 and formation. Outwit your opponent through a rock-paper-scissors
esque tactic picker. Make wily subsitutions to cement your lead or comeback from deficit.

## Team Picker

Pick from any one of 20 English sides to manage.

### Offline

In an offline single match, you can also pick your opponent and whether you will play at home or away.
There is no in-game difference whether you are home or away, except the side of the pitch you play on.

In an offline tournament, you cannot pick your opponent and you will always play at home. 15 other
teams will be picked out, at random from the rest of the sides, in order to make a knockout-style
compitition.

### Online

When online, you cannot pick your opponent and you will always play at home. Your opponent can manage
any one of the 20 teams, including the same side that you picked.

In a tournament, the same case applies. You will play up to 4 games against any team (including possibly
the same team multiple times). If you win all 4 games, you will win the tournament!

You can also play a single game against a friend on steam. This uses the steam invitation interface in
order to match you up. You will be able to invite multiple friends into a game, but you will only play
against the first friend that accepts the invite.

## Squad Selection

Drag and drop players around the pitch to find your preferred formation and lineup.

There are 3 sections of the pitch that you can put players into: _Attack_, _Midfield_ and _Defence_.
These sections correspond with the phases of play that you will see in the game. You must have at least
2 players in Defence and Midfield and at least 1 player in Attack. You are allowed a maximum of 5
Midfielders and Defenders and a maximum of 4 Attackers. And of course, you can only have 11 players
total on the pitch.

Each team has 2 Goalkeepers, 1 starter and 1 on the bench. Goalkeepers can only play in goal, however
you can move any other player around into any position of your choosing. Click on a player to see thier
stats and choose where they should start!

## In a Match

### Tactics

Before your players clash, you will need to pick your tactics. There are 3 possible tactics that you can
pick for each phase. Each tactic uses different stats from your players. As well as this, each tactic
will counter another in a rock-paper-scissors manner:

| Midfield tactic | Uses stats | Counters   |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Tiki-taka       | DIS + CRE  | Route One  |
| Gegenpress      | REC + TKO  | Tiki-Taka  |
| Route One       | SHO + RIG  | Gegenpress |

| Defence tactic | Uses stats | Counters          |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Contain        | REC + RIG  | Through Balls     |
| High Press     | RIG + TKO  | Long Shots        |
| Man Mark       | REC + DIS  | Stretch the Pitch |

| Attack tactic     | Uses stats | Counters   |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Long Shots        | SHO + CRE  | Contain    |
| Through Balls     | CRE + TKO  | Man Mark   |
| Stretch the Pitch | DIS + SHO  | High Press |

Choose your tactics & team wisely to play to your strengths, or counter your opponents!

### Periods & Phases

There are 4 periods in a game. During each period, there are 3 phases: _Midfield_ first, then _Attack_
and _Defence_. During the _Midfield_ phase, your midfielders will clash against your opponents midfield.
During the _Attack_ phase, your attack will clash against your opponents defence, and vice versa for
the _Defence_ phase.

Each phase has a different goal. For the defence phase, you simply want to stop your opponent from
scoring. If no attackers beat your defenders, the opponent can't score! During the midfield phase, any
players that win thier clash will provide a +1 bonus to all stats of all defenders and attackers.

### Scoring a Goal

During the attack phase, if attackers win thier clash, you will get a chance to score. The chance is
boosted for each attacker that wins thier clashes and there is equally a chance to miss, or for the
goalkeeper to make a save (dependant on the goalkeepers ability).

A wheel will spin, completely at random, and if it lands in the green then you've scored!

### Winning or losing

Of course, the team with more goals at the end of the game will be the winner.

In the case of a draw, during a single match, the game will end level. A draw in a tournament however
will end in penalties. From here, you can only sit back and watch as each player steps up (in order of
SHO ability) and attempts to score, with the same random spinner as above. This follows a typical
shootout format: best out of 5, then sudden death if still level.

## Enjoy

Thats about all you need to know!

## The Future of Field Clashers

I have a lot of plans for future potential features and improvements, a snapshot of these include:

- Away strips (or 2nd kits) and ability to choose your kit
- More kit styles (stripes & hoops etc)
- Ability to build your own team
- Save your team lineups
- Matchmaking (maybe ELO)
- Limited substitues
- Ghost opponents & improved AI
- Save tournament progress
- Player 'form'
- and many more...

Continued work depends on interest and demand, so make some noise if you'd like to see a change!
