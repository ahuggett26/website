# Higher Level

As an apprentice Software Engineer between ages of 18 and 21, I spent 80% of my time working and 20% of my time studying at college. This study culminated in a foundation degree certification in 2020, then a degree certification in 2021.

Education provider: [Ada, the National College of Digital Skills](https://www.ada.ac.uk).

Certificates validated and accredited by [The Open University](https://www.open.ac.uk/).

## BSc (Hons.) Digital and Technology Solutions | 2:1

To complete my degree, I took a Software Engineer specialism into the final year of the course.

This included modules around mobile and cloud development, AI & machine learning, general software engineering practices and ethics within software engineering for example. One of my favourite modules involved web and front-end development and best practises for developing UI.

My primary dissertation was focussed around my work on the Broad Queries feature that I was working on at the time for Google (see [Work](https://ahuggett.uk/work) tab for more).

### Foundation Degree in Digital Innovation | Distinction

For the first 2 years of my apprenticeship, I worked towards a foundation degree in Digital Innvoation. The work towards this would later contibute towards my degree, however a larger percentage of the degree was weighted towards the final year, where I was able to work towards a specialism.

Modules included in the foundation degree included algorithms, data structures, computing technologies and project management including the software development lifecycle and agile methodologies.

Programming in this first year was primarily done in JavaScript, whereas in my final year I would also use Java, TypeScript and Python among others.
