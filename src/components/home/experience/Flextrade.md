# FlexTrade

## Software Developer

I joined FlexTrade in September 2025, where I work hybridly - 3 days a week in their London office and 2 days a week from home.

At FlexTrade, I am on the UI team working on the [FlexOne OMS system](https://flextrade.com/products/flexone-order-execution-management-system/). The OMS is highly integrated with the [FlexTRADER EMS](https://flextrade.com/products/flextrader-execution-management-system/) (hence the OEMS), so while my work doesn't deal with the extreme high precision require by the EMS, we do have to integrate well with the EMS and remain responsive and effective.

The primary OMS system is a desktop application - built using Scala and fronted with Java Swing. To aid UI development, we also use multiple swing-based libraries, most notably JGoodies form frameworks.

FlexTrade is also developing a mobile and a web-based OMS application (built with React and TypeScript) which I will be working on as it grows in size and priority.

FlexTrade is a mid-size company, of 500-1000 employees across offices in US, UK, India and Singapore. While the UI team I work with is based in London, we also work closely with the backend team working in Milwaukee.
