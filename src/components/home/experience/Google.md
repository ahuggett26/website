## Apprentice Software Engineer

At Google, I worked as an appentice for 3 years. What this meant is that I spent 80% of my time working as a Software Engineer at Google, while 20% of my time was spent at college studying for my Degree qualification. After a 3 month induction at college in 2018, this worked out to spending 1 week at college for roughly 8 weeks at Google. 

### Google Go

My time at Google can more or less be split into 2 halves. During the first half, I worked on [Google Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.searchlite&hl=en_GB&gl=US).

Google Go is an Android app that currently has over 1 billion downloads, and is intended as a lightweight alternative to the Google search app, primarily for use within newer internet markets such as India and Indonesia.

I worked on many features for Google Go, including the in-built Google Assistant and Karaoke modes ("Make Google read it") and app page (where we would group websites & apps of interest into a single location for easy access).

One key feature that I worked on though was regarding user safety and [underage accounts](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409). This would be the first project that I led, and it would a review of the app and adding extra features to help suit the requirements of users who are under their countries age requirement.

### Broad Queries & the Next Billion Users

In the second half of my time at Google, I worked on an immersive PWA called Broad Queries. Broad Queries was a key part of an upcoming product internally dubbed 'Project Lingo'. This project would similarly be targetted towards newer internet markets, but in particular Google's '[Next Billion Users](https://blog.google/technology/next-billion-users/)'. The project would be intended for use directly inside the [Google Search App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox) and our team had a lot of cross-collaboration with the GSA team.

The web app was built with Typescript and CSS using the React framework. I was a part of the core team developing the front-end for Broad Queries and I became a UI code owner during this time - responsible for the maintenance and overall health of the front-end code.

The main focus of Broad Queries was to create a 'tap-focussed' experience, where users would be able to find what they wanted through suggestions, recommendations and favoritised grouping. The feature would categorise search results into groups and was intended to enable exploratory searching. 

For example, a user could search for 'music' and find certain trending results as well as other, more detailed queries like 'pop music' or a certain artist. Through this tap-navigation users could explore the web, finding results when they weren't sure how to form a useful search query. It would also be useful for users to find entertaining videos or music that they wanted to watch, or recipes that they wanted to make, for example, where they previously might not have searched specifically for those results.

Broad Queries would be highly visual, featuring primarily videos - both short and long form - as well as imagery wherever possible. We worked with our partner teams in order to provide this including the Google Web Server team who we utilising results from.

We launched a large amount of research studies and experiments with different versions of the product, but eventually the project was abandoned a short time after I left.
