        I work across the tech stack, but my expertise is in on the front-end,
        in particular with user-facing code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java is my most used language, but I am well versed in TypeScript, HTML,
        CSS & Kotlin, among others.

      <p>
        Some of the common frameworks I have used include ReactJS, Spring, Visx,
        JUnit, Jasmine, Mockito. <br />I have worked on Web apps, Websites,
        Android apps, Command Line Tools and even an IntelliJ plugin.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my weekends and days off, I have a range of personal coding
        projects that I work on. Take a look at the Portfolio tab for a look at
        some of these projects.

        One of my main joys in life is football. I have been a Brighton fan
        since promotion from League 1 at the Withdean and a season ticket holder
        since 2011. Whenever there is a home game, I try to make my way down to
        the AMEX with my dad.
