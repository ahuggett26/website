                Hi! My name is Andrew Huggett, I am a software engineer from West Sussex, in the south of England.<br/>
                I currently work for Diffblue, an Oxford based company that produces AI for code.
            </p>
            <ImageCarousel images={images} hoverText={hoverText}/>
            <p>
                I work across the tech stack, but my expertise is in on the front-end, in particular with user-facing code.
                Java is my most used language, but I am well versed in TypeScript, HTML and CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my weekends and days off, I have a range of personal projects that I work on.
                More recently I made more of an effort to ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù these: take a look at the Portfolio tab for an overview.
                I only have a certain amount of time though; I find that there is always more that I want to do, than what I have time for üòÖ
            </p>

                One of my main joys in life is football - most weekends I make my way down to Brighton with my dad to watch the game.
                I have been a Brighton fan since we got promoted from League 1 at the Withdean and a season ticket holder
                since we moved to Falmer in 2011, and the matches remain one of the highlights of my week.
